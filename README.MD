# React JS

## What is React JS?
React JS is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is used to create reusable UI components. React allows developers to build web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

## Key Features
- **Component-Based Architecture**: React encourages the development of reusable and modular components.
- **Virtual DOM**: React creates a virtual representation of the real DOM, which helps optimize and improve rendering performance.
- **Declarative**: React makes it easy to design interactive UIs with declarative code.
- **One-Way Data Binding**: React follows a unidirectional data flow, making it predictable and easier to debug.
- **JSX Syntax**: React uses JSX, a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML directly within JavaScript code.

## How to Set Up React JS?

### Prerequisite Apps
Before installing React JS, you need to have the following software installed on your system:
1. **Node.js**: React relies on Node.js for package management (NPM/Yarn). You can download it from the [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Code Editor**: A good code editor like Visual Studio Code is recommended for React development.

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Install Node.js and NPM
- **Download and install** Node.js from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Verify installation** by running the following commands:
  ```bash
